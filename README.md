newuser.sh
Add a new user

What does this script do? The quick answer is add a user and their ssh key to the local system. Once this is done the user will be able to login to the system presumably vi ssh using thier private key

newuser.sh is for adding new users to ubuntu.
To add this script to the system you will be adding users to follow the following steps.
    
    "vi newuser.sh"
    "i" for insert
    copy and paste the code text of newuser.sh into the file you are working in
    "shift + zz" to save and close the file
    
Now you must set the permissions on the file to execute

    "chmod +x newuser.sh"
    "./newuser.sh" will now execute the script
